          <div class="content-full"><p>The videos from the EPIC dataset were not all clean and tidy, some of them had random black frames, and some even had random red lines/patches through the frame. These factors were highly unfavourable when it came to training a good deep learning model. This problem was solved in <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/devoworm/GSoC-2020/blob/master/Pre-trained%20Models%20%28DevLearning%29/notebooks/embryo_analysis/video_analysis/data_cleanup.ipynb">this notebook</a>.</p>

<p>And as it turns out, these images were also acompanied with corrupt annotations, where the population went down to zero all of a sudden, even through the associated frames had well populated embryos. I called them the &ldquo;cliffs&rdquo;.</p>

<p>As it was seen above, some of the data points had cases where the population went down almost vertically all of a sudden. Upon further inspection, it was found that the frames associated with these drops were well populated with cells and definitely not as depicted by these &ldquo;cliff curves&rdquo;. So the next step was to remove them.</p>

</figure>

<p>Now the only problem that remained was to remove the corrupt random frames with the patches. For this problem, I went on with <a href="https://github.com/ujjwalll">ujjwal</a>&rsquo;s aproach, which involved dropping the frames with the highest loss after a few epochs of training and the re-train on the &ldquo;clean&rdquo; frames.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://mayukhdeb.github.io/blog/post/images/july_12/lossy_frames.png" width="90%"/> 
</figure>

<p>The plot above shows the loss of each frame in the training set, with the red lines highlighting the top 10% frames with the highest loss after training.</p>
<p>Expecting a much lower loss next week.</p>
