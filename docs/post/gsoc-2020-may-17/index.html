          <div class="content-full"><p>Ten weeks of proposal writing and 3 personal (but very beloved) deep learning projects later, I was selected for the only project I worked towards for GSoC, which was <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6078813261266944">Pre-trained models for developmental neuroscience</a> under <a href="https://www.incf.org/">INCF</a>. And things have been better than ever since then.</p>
<p>The first week was mostly me getting to know more about the OpenWorm community and what are they striving to do. I got to meet <a href="https://github.com/balicea">Dr. Bradley Alicea</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nvinayvarma189">Vinay Varma</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ujjwalll">Ujjwal Singh</a>. They gave me a warm welcome into the community.</p>
<p>I started setting up the environment right after the results were out, and cleaned up one of my <a href="https://github.com/Mayukhdeb/adventures-with-augmentation">older repos</a> which would act as a quick reference through the span of this project.</p>
<p>The first weekly meeting with OpenWorm gave me a much better idea of the goals of this project.</p>
<p>The key to a good deep learning model is good data. If the data is clean, half the battle is won. This led to the the first <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/devoworm/GSoC-2020/blob/master/Pre-trained%20Models%20%28DevLearning%29/notebooks/worm_tracking_pipeline.ipynb">notebook</a> which builds a pipeline for tracking and segmenting the worms directly from video files. The pipeline works as follows:</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The video file is first trimmed to shorten the clip to extract only a short subclip (this is optional).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the frames from the subclip are extracted from the video using <a href="https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/ref/ffmpeg.html">ffmpeg</a> and saved into a folder in a numerical sequence of filenames.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The locations of the worms are determined by drawing padded rectangles around the contours of the thresholded image.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</figure>

<ol start="4">
<li>The original image is then cropped and segmented to remove all background except the worm(s) in the image.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a GIF to visualise the tracking on the live feed.</p>

<p>Apart from all of this, I also read quite a few papers on the C.elegans worm. This was an effort towards getting more familiar with the underlying biological concepts surrounding the worm.</p>
