This was in context to abraham.ai.\nIn a nutshell, eden would be a way for people to easily host generative art pipelines with minimal modifications to the original code. It would also provide abraham.ai with a generalised framework to port new pipelines into the website.\nEden bridges the gap between the generative artist’s hacky code and a well hosted server backend.\nEnvisioning I want to see eden as a framework which can be used to convert anyones code to a servable pipeline with minimal additions/deletions to the original code.\nEvolution taught us that we either have to be fast or hard to survive. Eden chooses to be fast. What I mean by fast is that eden should be the fastest way to port new art pipelines into a server to host it on a website.\nEden should be a place where artists are not afraid to go wild with their ideas, without worrying about the “worldly problem” of hosting it.\nEvery unit within eden is a BaseBlock, it is somehting that takes in an input (or “DNA” as Gene Kogan called it) and returns an output. Every BaseBlock can be hosted with a simple host() method.\nIdeally, one should be able to mix and match blocks (like running style transfer on a CLIP+VQGAN text to image pipeline). But that’s something which we can work on after we have an MVP ready for the twitter flex.\n@eden_block.run(args = my_args) def do_something(config): # do something here return something eden_block.host( port= 5656, max_num_workers= 4 ## max 4 threads ) A breath of fresh air The more I read about the idea, the more I felt like I should be a part of it. But this meant that I would have to go out of my usual pytorch zone to something completely different.\nThankfully I wasn’t starting from scratch. I already had hacked together a few fastAPI model serving pipelines before, so I knew that it would help.\nNot so fresh bugs Like any other project, eden too has had a fair share of ugly bugs, which were dealt with. This was the first time I was working with tools like celery.\nI realised that I did not just like deep-learning. Building stuff is what I really liked. Deep-learning was just one way to do it.\nLooking ahead Eden has not been fully built yet, but I plan to use this blog post as a way to track myself here through it’s genesis :)\n",
